# pygame_shooting
It's a small program I did it for fun. <br />
I saw a pygame tutorial video on Youtube. <br />
I couldn't find the source toturial video with keyword "pygame shooting" anymore.<br />
I believed that I learned this from **techwithtim** or **freecodecamp**. <br />

## Introduction
It's a offline game.
You and your opponent control different cat. <br />
The cats can fire bullet at each other. <br />
The winner will be the one that has health left at the end. <br />
Luca is smaller so he has less health, but he can move faster. <br />
Lumi is bigger with more health, but she moves slower. <br /><br />

I adopted Luca and Lumi in 2020. <br />
They are cutest family memebers and my friends love them. <br /> <br />

## Dependencies
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

## How to play
1. start the program
```
python3 main.py
```
2. The game window will pop up.
